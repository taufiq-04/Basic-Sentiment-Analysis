# 🧠 Simple Sentiment Analyzer (Beginner Python Project)

This is a basic sentiment analysis script written in Python that identifies whether a review is **Positive** or **Negative** based on the presence of positive keywords.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. Loads a list of positive words from `positive_words.txt`
2. Cleans and tokenizes user reviews
3. Counts how many positive words each review contains
4. Labels sentiment as **Positive** if there are 2 or more positive words, else **Negative**
